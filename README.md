# Stock_Market-Forecasting
This project explores the prediction of stock market prices using five distinct machine learning models: Support Vector Regressor (SVR), Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM). The primary goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of these models in forecasting stock prices and to identify the key factors influencing stock market movements.
