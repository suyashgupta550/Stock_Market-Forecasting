# Stock_Market-Forecasting


This project explores the prediction of stock market prices using five distinct machine learning models: Support Vector Regressor (SVR), Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM). The primary goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of these models in forecasting stock prices and to identify the key factors influencing stock market movements.

Objectives
 Assess the predictive power of various machine learning techniques in stock market forecasting.
 Compare the performance of different models using statistical evaluation metrics.
 Provide insights that can guide the development of new financial models or enhance existing ones.
